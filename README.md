```Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

Hi! Welcome to Linuhackx: The Linux distribution for hacking! This is still in early stages (uploading original kernel code), so don't expect to use this soon. Still, if you want to help out with the project, here's what you can do:
1. Upload Linux Kernel code
2. Add other helpful libraries

Thanks for checking this out! Make sure to ‚≠ê, ‚åö, and üç¥! (Star, watch, and fork. Don't knife, whatever that means üòï)
